# UX Case Studies
all research methods used from user interviews to usability testing

this repository is a collection of ux case studies conducted collectively (with academic colleagues) and personally (in relation to the documents) to explore and improve digital systems that students regularly interact with.

each project addresses a real-world problem in usability, accessibility, or functionality of an existing digital platform, especially those affecting students in metro manila.

these case studies apply multiple ux research methods such as interviews, usability evaluations, and information architecture analysis to propose evidence-based improvements.
