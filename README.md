# UX Case Studies

All research methods used range from user interviews to usability testing.

This repository is a collection of UX case studies conducted both collaboratively (with academic colleagues) and independently. These aim to explore and improve digital systems that students regularly interact with.

Each project addresses a real-world problem in usability, accessibility, or functionality of an existing digital platform, especially those affecting students in Metro Manila.

These case studies apply multiple UX research methods, including interviews, usability evaluations, and information architecture analysis, to propose evidence-based improvements.
